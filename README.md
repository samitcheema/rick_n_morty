- What architectural decisions did you make and why? Elaborate on strengths and weaknesses.
  - Strength: chaining apis and aggregating data into one optimal state to avoid having to combine two different api responses into one. 
  - Weakness: Needs more modularity, components are still being rendered using App.js instead of passing it down using props. 
- How did you handle error cases? Eg: botched response, no response, etc.
  - Try catch statement within api call which catches error and prints to console and sets a state called status to false if rejected or true if resolved. depending on status state values, it renders a gif on the page. 
- How did you test the app?
  - Was implementing react testing library but couldn't complete it due to limitation. 
- What third party libraries/ external code snippets did you use, if any?
  - Axios
- If you had more time, what would you have done differently?
  - Definitely worked on modularity and testing along with styling. I got too caught up on optimal functionality.
